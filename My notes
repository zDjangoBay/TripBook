 Complete Implementation Summary - TripBook Authentication & Profile Management
🎯 Overview
Today we implemented a comprehensive authentication system and profile management features for the TripBook Android app, transforming it from a basic trip booking app into a fully user-centric application with persistent data storage.
🔐 1. Authentication System Implementation
Login & Signup Screens
LoginScreen.kt: Complete login interface with email/password fields, validation, and demo credentials
SignupScreen.kt: Full registration form with first name, last name, username, email, password, and confirmation
Password Security: Basic password hashing implementation for secure storage
Input Validation: Real-time form validation with error messaging
User Session Management
UserSessionManager.kt: Singleton pattern for managing user authentication state
Persistent Sessions: SharedPreferences integration for session persistence across app restarts
StateFlow Integration: Reactive user state management with Compose
Automatic Session Restoration: Users stay logged in between app launches
Database Integration
Updated UserEntity: Added password_hash and bio fields
Database Migrations: Implemented migrations from v1→v2→v3 for schema updates
User-Specific Data: All reservations now linked to authenticated users
💾 2. Data Persistence & Repository Pattern
Reservation Data Persistence
ReservationRepository.kt: New repository pattern for database operations
Database Storage: Reservations now permanently stored in SQLite database
User Association: All trip reservations linked to specific user accounts
Real-time Updates: UI automatically reflects database changes
Updated Data Flow
Before: Reservations stored in memory only (lost on app restart)
After: Reservations persisted in database with user association
ReservationSessionManager: Updated to save to database instead of memory
ReservationsDashboardViewModel: Now loads data from database via repository
👤 3. Profile Management System
Enhanced ProfileScreen
User Information Display: Shows current user's name and email
Scrollable Interface: All profile options accessible via scroll
Prominent Logout: Red-styled "Sign Out" option for clear visibility
Navigation Integration: Connects to Edit Profile functionality
Complete Edit Profile Screen
ProfilePicture Section: Display and change photo functionality (placeholder)
Personal Information Form:
First Name & Last Name (side-by-side layout)
Username (with lowercase validation)
Email (with email keyboard type)
Phone Number (with phone keyboard type)
Bio (multi-line text field)
Real-time Validation: Form validation with error/success messaging
Material Design 3: Modern UI with proper theming and animations
🏗️ 4. Architecture Improvements
Navigation Enhancement
DashboardActivity: Updated with new navigation routes
Edit Profile Navigation: Seamless flow between Profile → Edit Profile → Back
Authentication Flow: Login/Signup → Dashboard with proper state management
Database Schema Evolution

-- Version 1 → 2: Added password authentication
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN password_hash TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''

-- Version 2 → 3: Added bio field for profiles
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN bio TEXT

Dependency Injection Pattern
Singleton Managers: UserSessionManager and ReservationSessionManager
Context-Aware: Proper application context usage throughout
Database Integration: Consistent database instance sharing
🔄 5. Complete User Flow Implementation
Authentication Flow
App Launch → Check authentication status
Not Authenticated → Login/Signup screens
Successful Auth → Dashboard with full functionality
Session Persistence → Auto-login on subsequent app launches
Profile Management Flow
Profile Tab → View current user information
Edit Profile → Comprehensive editing interface
Save Changes → Database update with validation
Logout → Clear session and return to authentication
Data Persistence Flow
Make Reservation → Save to database with user ID
Close App → Data remains in database
Reopen App → User still logged in, reservations still available
Switch Users → Each user sees only their own data
🎨 6. UI/UX Enhancements
Material Design 3 Implementation
Consistent Theming: Primary, secondary, and error color schemes
Modern Components: Cards, buttons, text fields with proper elevation
Responsive Design: Scrollable interfaces and proper spacing
Loading States: Progress indicators and disabled states during operations
User Experience Improvements
Error Handling: Comprehensive error messaging and validation
Success Feedback: Clear confirmation of successful operations
Intuitive Navigation: Back buttons and logical flow between screens
Accessibility: Proper content descriptions and keyboard navigation
🚀 7. Technical Achievements
