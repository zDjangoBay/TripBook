2. **Local Cache**: Room database for offline access
3. **Repositories**: Single source of truth for data
4. **ViewModels**: Transform data for UI consumption
5. **UI**: Reactive interface using Compose

### Key Components

- **Navigation**: Single-activity architecture with Compose Navigation
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean dependency management
- **Coroutines**: Asynchronous programming
- **StateFlow**: Reactive state management
- **Mappers**: Clean data transformation between layers
