Feat: Implement CRUD Operations for Trips and Itinerary Items

This pull request introduces comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities for both main Trip objects and their associated Itinerary Items.

Key Changes:

Trip Management (MyTripsScreen.kt & TripViewModel.kt):
Update Trip:
Added "Edit" buttons to each TripCard on MyTripsScreen.kt.
Implemented an AlertDialog for editing trip details (name, destination, dates, travelers, budget).
Integrated tripViewModel.updateTrip() call to persist changes to the Supabase backend.
Delete Trip:
Added "Delete" buttons to each TripCard on MyTripsScreen.kt.
Implemented a confirmation AlertDialog before deletion.
Integrated tripViewModel.deleteTrip() call to remove trips from the Supabase backend.
Dependencies: Ensured TripViewModel.kt contains updateTrip and deleteTrip methods to handle these operations, interacting with SupabaseTripRepository.
