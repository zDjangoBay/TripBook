## Features Implemented

### 1. Hero Image Carousel
- **Description**: Horizontal scrollable image gallery showing review images
- **Implementation**: LazyRow with image loading via Coil
- **Visual Enhancement**: Gradient overlay for better text visibility
- **Responsive Design**: 350dp width cards with proper aspect ratio

### 2. Review Rating Display
- **Star Rating**: Visual 5-star rating system
- **Dynamic Icons**: Filled stars for rating, outlined for remaining
- **Color Coding**: Gold stars (#FFD700) for rated, gray for unrated
- **Numerical Display**: Shows rating as "X.0" format

### 3. Interactive Like System
- **Toggle Functionality**: Users can like/unlike reviews
- **Visual Feedback**:
  - Heart icon changes from outline to filled
  - Background color changes when liked
  - Counter updates in real-time
- **State Management**: Local state with random initial count (10-50)

### 4. Flag/Report System
- **Purpose**: Allow users to flag inappropriate content
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Flag icon toggles between outline and filled
  - Orange accent color (#FF9800) when flagged
  - Circular background highlight when active

### 5. Comments System
- **Display**: Horizontal scrolling comment cards
- **Add Comments**: Full comment creation interface
- **Image Attachments**: Users can attach images to comments
- **Shared Storage**: Comments persist across screens via CommentStorage
- **Author Information**: Shows user avatar, name, and timestamp

### 6. Comment Creation Interface
- **Multi-line Input**: 3-5 line text field for comment content
- **Image Picker**: Integration with Android image picker
- **Image Preview**: Shows selected image with removal option
- **Validation**: Submit button only enabled when text is present
- **Automatic Timestamp**: Comments include creation time

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Components
```kotlin
// Data Models
data class Comment(
    val id: String,
    val text: String,
    val imageUri: String?,
    val timestamp: String,
    val authorName: String
)

// State Management
var isLiked by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
var isFlagged by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }
var likeCount by remember { mutableStateOf((10..50).random()) }
val comments = remember { mutableStateListOf<Comment>() }
```

### Key Components
1. **Scaffold Structure**: Proper Material3 scaffold with top bar
2. **LazyColumn Layout**: Efficient scrolling for content sections
3. **Card-based Design**: Material3 cards for content organization
4. **State Synchronization**: SharedComments integration for persistence

### Image Handling
- **Library**: Coil for async image loading
- **Picker Integration**: ActivityResultContracts.GetContent()
- **Preview System**: Real-time image preview with removal option
- **Content Scaling**: Proper crop scaling for consistent display

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- **Material3 Theming**: Full Material You design language
- **Elevation System**: Proper shadow and elevation hierarchy
- **Color Consistency**: Theme-aware colors throughout
- **Typography Scale**: Consistent text styling

### Interaction Design
- **Haptic Feedback**: Visual state changes for all interactions
- **Loading States**: Smooth transitions and state updates
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of image loading failures
- **Accessibility**: Proper content descriptions for screen readers

### Navigation
- **Back Navigation**: Consistent navigation patterns
- **Deep Linking**: Support for direct review access via reviewId
- **State Preservation**: Comments and interactions persist during navigation

## Code Quality & Architecture

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, data, and business logic separation
- **State Management**: Proper Compose state handling
- **Memory Management**: Efficient image loading and caching
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout the implementation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: LazyColumn and LazyRow for efficient scrolling
- **Image Caching**: Coil handles image caching automatically
- **State Hoisting**: Minimal recomposition through proper state design
- **Memory Efficient**: Proper lifecycle management
