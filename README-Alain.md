# TripBook Feature Contributions (Alain Kimbu)

## Summary of the Changes

This document outlines the contributions made to the TripBook tripcatalog project

### 1. User Profile Embedding (Mini-Profile in Trip Cards)
- **Componentization:**
  - Created `UserAvatar`, `MiniProfileTruncated`, and `UserListDialog` composables in `MiniProfile.kt` for modular user avatar display.
  - Refactored `TripCard` to accept a `miniProfileContent` composable slot, allowing flexible injection of mini-profile UI.
- **UI/UX:**
  - Trip cards now show a row of avatars for users who have taken the trip.
  - If there are more users than fit, a "+N" indicator appears. Tapping the avatars opens a dialog listing all users.

### 2. Review Section Enhancements
- **Voting:**
  - Added a `votes` property to the `Review` model.
  - Updated `ReviewCard` to display upvote/downvote buttons and vote count.
  - `MockReviewViewModel` now supports voting logic.
- **Pagination & Sorting:**
  - `MockReviewViewModel` supports paginated review loading and sorting (by votes, by date placeholder).
  - Sample reviews in `SampleReviews.kt` now include initial vote counts.

### 3. General Refactoring
- Extracted reusable UI components for avatars and dialogs.
- Updated demo data to showcase new features.
- Improved composable signatures for better slot-based UI injection.
