## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture pattern
- **Repository Pattern** for data management
- **Compose UI** for modern declarative UI

### Key Technologies
- **Jetpack Compose**: Modern UI toolkit for building native UI
- **Material Design 3**: Latest Material Design components and theming
- **Kotlin Coroutines & Flow**: For asynchronous operations and reactive programming
- **Animation API**: For fluid UI transitions and effects

### UI Components
- Custom animations using `AnimationUtils`
- Reusable components for consistency
- Responsive layouts using `ConstraintLayout` and `BoxWithConstraints`
- Theming with custom color palette

## Design Choices

### Color Scheme
- **Primary Color**: Purple (#6200EE) - Used for primary actions, selected states, and emphasis
- **Secondary Color**: Orange (#FF8800) - Used for accents, highlights, and secondary actions
- **Status Colors**:
  - Confirmed: Purple (#6200EE)
  - Pending: Orange (#FF8800)
  - Cancelled: Red (#EA4335)
  - Completed: Light Purple (#AB47BC)

### Animation Types
- **Slide-in/out**: For page transitions
- **Fade-in/out**: For content changes
