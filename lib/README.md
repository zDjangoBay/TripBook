# TripBook Company Catalog

This implementation provides a company catalog module for the TripBook social network application. The company catalog allows travelers to discover, view details, and review travel-related companies across Africa.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns:

### Backend (Kotlin)

- **Models**: Data classes that represent the core business entities
- **Repositories**: Interface and implementation for data access operations
- **Services**: Business logic layer that coordinates operations
- **API**: Controllers/endpoints for HTTP API access
- **Application**: Main application configuration and entry point

### Frontend (Flutter)

- **Models**: Classes that mirror the backend data structures
- **Services**: API client services for backend communication
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components
- **Screens**: Full application screens
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and configuration

## Data Flow

The flow of data through the application follows this pattern:

1. User interacts with the UI (Flutter screens and widgets)
2. Screen components call services to fetch or modify data
3. Services make HTTP requests to the backend API
4. Backend controllers receive the requests and delegate to services
5. Services apply business logic and call repositories as needed
6. Repositories handle data persistence operations
7. Results flow back through the layers to update the UI

## Database Schema (Implied)

While the implementation uses in-memory storage for simplicity, the models imply this database schema:

- **Companies Table**: Stores company information
- **Locations Table**: Stores location data (related to companies)
- **Services Table**: Stores services offered by companies
- **Reviews Table**: Stores user reviews of companies

## Key Features

   - Helpful marking functionality

### Frontend

1. **Company Discovery**:
   - Browsable company catalog with search and filters
   - Featured and top-rated sections
   - Visual indicators for verified and featured status

2. **Company Details**:
   - Tabbed interface for company information
   - Services listing with categorization
   - Contact information with actionable links

3. **Review System**:

   - Helpful marking functionality

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Authentication Integration**: Connect to the main app's authentication system
2. **Favorites/Bookmarks**: Allow users to save companies for later
3. **Location Services**: Real map integration with directions
4. **Advanced Filtering**: More filter options based on specific services or features
5. **Reporting System**: Allow users to report problematic companies or reviews
6. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest companies based on user preferences and history
